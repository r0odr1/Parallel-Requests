# Parallel requests

## Overview ‚úçÔ∏è

For this exercise, we will use the Rick & Morty API.

We want to have a page that displays the first 20 episodes of Rick & Morty and shows the first 10 characters that participated in the episode. We only want to see the name and species of the character.

To achieve this, we will use parallel requests to obtain the data for the episodes and the characters. Afterward, we will perform a transformation to obtain the expected result
